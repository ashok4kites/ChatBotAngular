# ChatBot

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Build and deploy using nginx server setup :
  Before working on chatbot, have adamantium setup done previously.
    from adamantium front-end folder, after build (see instructions in adamantium repo),
    run "sudo rsync -r ./bin/ /var/www/app-dev.fourkites.com/"

    in /etc/hosts file: set
      `127.0.0.1 mp-dev.fourkites.com`

    update /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf file
      ```server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80 ipv6only=on;

        root /var/www/app-dev.fourkites.com/;
        index index.html index.htm;

        server_name mp-dev.fourkites.com;

        location / {
            # First attempt to serve request as file, then
            # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
            # Uncomment to enable naxsi on this location
            # include /etc/nginx/naxsi.rules
        }

        location /athena/ {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /athena/index.html;
        }
      }```

    build and run following commands :
      ```ng build --base-href /athena/ --environment=prod
      sudo rsync -r ./dist/ /var/www/app-dev.fourkites.com/athena/
      sudo nginx -s stop; sleep 5; sudo nginx```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --base-href /athena/ --environment=prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--environment=prod|staging|dev` flag for a production build, dev and staging respectively.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Running gulp for development purpose

Run `sudo gulp build --ENV <ENVIRONMENT> --DIR=$NGINX_SERVER_DIR` (Note: It will run with sudo command and enter password if asked (For Permission). Will build & rysnc the dist folder and start nginx server. And it will keep watching the files and trigger build rync workflow again for every file changes (HTML SCSS & TS)) 

`$NGINX_SERVER_DIR` - is your env variable which you need to set in `~/.bash_profile` and restart the terminal.

Run `control + z` to terminate the workflow
